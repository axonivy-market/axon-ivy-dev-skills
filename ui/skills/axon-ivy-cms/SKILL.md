# Axon Ivy CMS

Manage content under `<project>/cms/`. Preserve existing content and references unless the task requires changing them.

## Select the Workflow

Read the relevant file before making changes:

- Text content: Read `text-workflow.md` for labels, translations, messages, and email templates stored in `cms_<locale>.yaml`.
- File content: Read `file-workflow.md` for images, CSS, PDFs, and other resources stored directly under `cms/`.
- Mixed changes: Read both files.
